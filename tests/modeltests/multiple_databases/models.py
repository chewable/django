XXX. Using multiple database connections

Django normally uses only a single database connection. However,
support is available for using any number of different, named
connections. Multiple database support is entirely optional and has
no impact on your application if you don't use it.

Named connections are defined in your settings module. Create a
`OTHER_DATABASES` variable that is a dict, mapping connection names to their
particulars. The particulars are defined in a dict with the same keys
as the variable names as are used to define the default connection, with one
addition: MODELS.

The MODELS item in an OTHER_DATABASES entry is a list of the apps and models
that will use that connection. 

Access to named connections is through `django.db.connections`, which
behaves like a dict: you access connections by name. Connections are
established lazily, when accessed.  `django.db.connections[database]`
holds a `ConnectionInfo` instance, with the attributes:
`DatabaseError`, `backend`, `get_introspection_module`,
`get_creation_module`, and `runshell`.

To access a model's connection, use its manager. The connection is available
at `model._default_manager.db.connection`. To find the backend or other
connection metadata, use `model._meta.db` to access the full ConnectionInfo
with connection metadata.
